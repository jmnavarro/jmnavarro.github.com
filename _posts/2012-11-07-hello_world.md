Hi there and welcome to my humble and tiny corner!

Some years ago, in the dawn of the Internet, I used to have <a class="empty" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090221102826/http://lawebdejm.com/index.html">my own personal website</a> (yes, much before weblogs were invented), but now it's time to be more minimalist, so I guess this corner should be enough.

I'll write about technology (I'm under github, so it's a must, isn't it?), some random thoughts and perhaps some stuff of my personal life in the real world.

I'll try to write in English as much as I can, but don't cry if you see some posts in my mother tongue (Spanish)

Soâ€¦ thanks for stay tuned!
